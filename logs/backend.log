After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country.

We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening hours.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595193296/partyImgs/dvdheiclrqrzehrthzmi.jpg","fee":"0","likes":0,"startDate":"2020-08-04T15:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-08-04T21:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Israel, Jerusalem","lat":31.768319,"lng":35.21371},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Techno","Drum & Electrtonic","Disco"],"partyTypes":["Fetsival","Live Concert"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[]}},{"_id":"5f14d6cb4109c723500beb57","name":"Shay","desc":"Wow!","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595201179/partyImgs/fy3j0ss78n6t3bxl2y5v.jpg","fee":"0","likes":0,"startDate":"2020-07-20T02:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-07-20T10:30:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel","lat":32.0852999,"lng":34.78176759999999},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Retro","Reggae","Trance","World"],"partyTypes":["Clubbing","Fetsival","Karaoke","Open Mic"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[]}}]

We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening hours.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595193296/partyImgs/dvdheiclrqrzehrthzmi.jpg","fee":0,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-08-04T15:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-08-04T21:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Israel, Jerusalem","lat":31.768319,"lng":35.21371},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Techno","Drum & Electrtonic","Disco"],"partyTypes":["Fetsival","Live Concert"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":3}},{"_id":"5f14d6cb4109c723500beb57","name":"Shay","desc":"Wow!","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595201179/partyImgs/fy3j0ss78n6t3bxl2y5v.jpg","fee":0,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-07-20T02:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-07-20T10:30:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel","lat":32.0852999,"lng":34.78176759999999},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Retro","Reggae","Trance","World"],"partyTypes":["Clubbing","Fetsival","Karaoke","Open Mic"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":4}}]

The air tasted so heavenly with the chefs alongside the parade, every delicious thing ready to be shared with friends.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595073524/partyImgs/tbu3pwajhnhq3ycleknr.jpg","fee":0,"likes":8,"startDate":"2020-07-17T22:00:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-07-18T14:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":12,"createdAt":1541652422,"location":{"name":"Israel, Tel aviv","lat":32.0852999,"lng":34.78176759999999},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Trance","Music","Techno","Funk","Metal"],"partyTypes":["Karaoke","Rave","Sing","Workshop"],"createdBy":{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"},"members":[{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"},{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":2}},{"_id":"5f141bd36db1ac954bf5db3f","name":"Trance Party!","desc":"The best party ever","imgUrl":"https://d1csarkz8obe9u.cloudfront.net/posterpreviews/glow-disco-party-poster-template-2d310ac36d313dfc6fbc11b714f3859f_screen.jpg?ts=1561530801","fee":0,"likes":4,"startDate":"2020-07-17T22:00:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-07-18T14:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":12,"createdAt":1541652422,"location":{"name":"Israel, Ramat Gan","lat":32.068424,"lng":34.824785},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Trance","Music","Techno"],"partyTypes":["Karaoke","Rave","Sing","Workshop","Pool"],"createdBy":{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"},"members":[{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"},{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":2}},{"_id":"5f141bd36db1ac954bf5db41","name":"Beach Hangout","desc":"","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1594996604/partyImgs/bqqumghixzt0cvgflful.jpg","fee":0,"likes":4,"startDate":"2020-07-17T20:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-07-18T12:30:00.000+03:00","durationHours":12,"createdAt":1541652422,"location":{"name":"Israel","lat":33.55,"lng":35.77},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Trance","Music","Techno"],"partyTypes":["Karaoke","Rave","Sing","Workshop"],"createdBy":{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"},"members":[{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"},{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":2}},{"_id":"5f141bd36db1ac954bf5db40","name":"Beach party","desc":"The best party ever!\nYou will never forget this party!","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595104849/partyImgs/wdasxavk205i55bqrgth.jpg","fee":0,"likes":3,"startDate":"2020-07-17T16:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-07-17T17:30:00.000+03:00","durationHours":12,"createdAt":1541652422,"location":{"name":"Israel","lat":34.55,"lng":34.77},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Trance","Music","Techno"],"partyTypes":["Karaoke","Rave","Sing","Workshop"],"createdBy":{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"},"members":[{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"},{"_id":"u101","fullName":"Orly Amdadi","imgUrl":"http://some-img"}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":2}},{"_id":"5f141bd36db1ac954bf5db42","name":"my king of party","desc":"thisa is part.......","imgUrl":"https://d1csarkz8obe9u.cloudfront.net/posterpreviews/glow-disco-party-poster-template-2d310ac36d313dfc6fbc11b714f3859f_screen.jpg?ts=1561530801","fee":110,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-07-24T23:45:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-07-18T23:45:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"tel aviv","lat":32.0852999,"lng":34.78176759999999},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Hip Hop","Reggae"],"partyTypes":["Jamming","Pool"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":2}},{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening hours.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595193296/partyImgs/dvdheiclrqrzehrthzmi.jpg","fee":0,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-08-04T15:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-08-04T21:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Israel, Jerusalem","lat":31.768319,"lng":35.21371},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Techno","Drum & Electrtonic","Disco"],"partyTypes":["Fetsival","Live Concert"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":3}},{"_id":"5f14d6cb4109c723500beb57","name":"Shay","desc":"Wow!","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595201179/partyImgs/fy3j0ss78n6t3bxl2y5v.jpg","fee":0,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-07-20T02:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-07-20T10:30:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel","lat":32.0852999,"lng":34.78176759999999},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Retro","Reggae","Trance","World"],"partyTypes":["Clubbing","Fetsival","Karaoke","Open Mic"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":4}}]

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate.

We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening hours.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595193296/partyImgs/dvdheiclrqrzehrthzmi.jpg","fee":0,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-08-04T15:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-08-04T21:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Israel, Jerusalem","lat":31.768319,"lng":35.21371},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Techno","Drum & Electrtonic","Disco"],"partyTypes":["Fetsival","Live Concert"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":3}},{"_id":"5f14d6cb4109c723500beb57","name":"Shay","desc":"Wow!","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595201179/partyImgs/fy3j0ss78n6t3bxl2y5v.jpg","fee":0,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-07-20T02:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-07-20T10:30:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel","lat":32.0852999,"lng":34.78176759999999},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Retro","Reggae","Trance","World"],"partyTypes":["Clubbing","Fetsival","Karaoke","Open Mic"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":4}}]

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda.

After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning

Mon, 20 Jul 2020 13:12:18 GMT - Debug - [{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening hours.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595193296/partyImgs/dvdheiclrqrzehrthzmi.jpg","fee":50,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-08-04T15:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-08-04T21:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Israel,

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country.

Mon, 20 Jul 2020 13:27:33 GMT - Debug - [{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening hours.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595193296/partyImgs/dvdheiclrqrzehrthzmi.jpg","fee":50,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-08-04T15:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-08-04T21:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Israel, Jerusalem","lat":31.768319,"lng":35.21371},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Techno","Drum & Electrtonic","Disco"],"partyTypes":["Fetsival","Live Concert"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":3}},{"_id":"5f14d6cb4109c723500beb57","name":"Shay","desc":"Wow!","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595201179/partyImgs/fy3j0ss78n6t3bxl2y5v.jpg","fee":0,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-07-20T02:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-07-20T10:30:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel","lat":32.0852999,"lng":34.78176759999999},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Retro","Reggae","Trance","World"],"partyTypes":["Clubbing","Fetsival","Karaoke","Open Mic"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":4}}]

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

Mon, 20 Jul 2020 13:28:30 GMT - Debug - [{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly

Mon, 20 Jul 2020 13:28:36 GMT - Debug - [{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening hours.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595193296/partyImgs/dvdheiclrqrzehrthzmi.jpg","fee":50,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-08-04T15:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-08-04T21:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Israel,

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

Mon, 20 Jul 2020 13:31:27 GMT - Debug - [{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening hours.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595193296/partyImgs/dvdheiclrqrzehrthzmi.jpg","fee":50,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-08-04T15:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-08-04T21:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Israel,

Mon, 20 Jul 2020 13:33:47 GMT - Debug - [{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening hours.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595193296/partyImgs/dvdheiclrqrzehrthzmi.jpg","fee":50,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-08-04T15:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-08-04T21:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Israel, Jerusalem","lat":31.768319,"lng":35.21371},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Techno","Drum & Electrtonic","Disco"],"partyTypes":["Fetsival","Live Concert"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":3}},{"_id":"5f14d6cb4109c723500beb57","name":"Shay","desc":"Wow!","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595201179/partyImgs/fy3j0ss78n6t3bxl2y5v.jpg","fee":0,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-07-20T02:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-07-20T10:30:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel","lat":32.0852999,"lng":34.78176759999999},"extraData":{"musicTypes":["Retro","Reggae","Trance","World"],"partyTypes":["Clubbing","Fetsival","Karaoke","Open Mic"],"createdBy":{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},"members":[{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""},{"_id":"","fullName":"","imgUrl":""}],"reviews":[],"membersCnt":4}}]

We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

Mon, 20 Jul 2020 14:32:42 GMT - Debug - [{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening

Mon, 20 Jul 2020 14:32:43 GMT - Debug - [{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening hours.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595193296/partyImgs/dvdheiclrqrzehrthzmi.jpg","fee":50,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-08-04T15:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-08-04T21:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Israel,

Mon, 20 Jul 2020 14:32:45 GMT - Debug - [{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening hours.","imgUrl":"http://res.cloudinary.com/partytime/image/upload/v1595193296/partyImgs/dvdheiclrqrzehrthzmi.jpg","fee":50,"likes":0,"startDate":"2020-08-04T15:30:00.000+03:00","endDate":"2020-08-04T21:00:00.000+03:00","durationHours":0,"createdAt":0,"location":{"name":"Israel,

Mon, 20 Jul 2020 14:32:45 GMT - Debug - [{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening

Mon, 20 Jul 2020 14:39:17 GMT - Debug - [{"_id":"5f14b86a4109c723500beb56","name":"JERUSALEM MARCH FOR PRIDE AND TOLERANCE 2020","desc":"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance has become the largest and most significant civil rights movement in Jerusalem. It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly evening

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us.

It has been going on for over 15 years and symbolizes a persistent struggle for equal rights, liberty, personal security and protection. \n\nOn 6.6.19 we will march at the 18th Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance, produced by the Jerusalem Open House for Pride & Tolerance – themed “one community, many faces”.\n\nIn the face of relentless attempts to exclude the LGBT public and the “odd-one-out” (of every variety and variance) from the Israeli public, we will celebrate the incredible diversity of the gay community – from all sectors, faiths, backgrounds, identities and genders.\n\nWe shall celebrate our life stories, each one “a world entire” – and refuse to be pushed into closets or put into boxes – and instead march with our heads held high in our capital city, Jerusalem.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the 2019 Pride season commences in the Jerusalem March for Pride & Tolerance. After a year of stormy elections – local and national – we will demand from the Knesset and the elected government an immediate amendment to the legal discrimination against us and a campaign against the violence directed at LGBTs every day around the country. We will remind our elected officials their many pledges during the election campaign – and march in full force in a show of strength, to now turn these pledges into actions.\n\nThis year we will also mark 4 years since the heinous and despicable hate crime at which Shira Banki RIP was murdered and six others injured, and 10 years since the unsolved massacre at the BarNoar, in which Nir Katz and Liz Trobishi RIP lost their lives. We will remind that is is not enough to be shocked by the bloody price which hatred has demanded. This is a call to arms, to the entire Israeli public: this is the time for us to join forces! This is the time to build, and demand a society of unity instead of rifts, of building bridges between people and communities instead of idle hate. Only a national campaign – of LGBTs and our allies from all parts of society – shall offer an alternative of hope to the violent and divisive discourse.\n\nAlongside the pain, this year also marks 50 years since the Stonewall Riots. The flag raised then, at a small New York bar, by LGBTs who refused to accept a reality of violence and blatant inequality – continues to echo, 50 years on, at Pride Marches around the globe – both in places where full equal rights have been won and where LGBTs are still persecuted and even killed.\n\nAs we mark 50 years since this important milestone of our liberation – we will go back to marching in June, the international Pride month, and together lead a different national day agenda. We will bring the voices of the LGBT public to every household in this country. We will demand from decision-makers – at the Knesset, government, Supreme Court, local government and all else – to correct the twisted reality at which we are second-class citizens. From this historic Jerusalem march, we will depart to a summer of protest and a nationwide battle.\n\nThis is the time, this is the hour, LGBTs and Allies: families, friends, colleagues at work, school, places of worship and golden-age homes – join us. Together we shall win!\n\n6.6.2019 || Third day of Sivan 5779 || Jerusalem\n\nCome march with us!\n\nSchedule and route:\n15:30 – 17:00 Gathering at Gan HaPa’amon and Opening Stage\n17:30 – Beginning of March\n19:30 – 21:00 – Rally at Main Stage at Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nThe March will go along the following route: Gan- HaPa’amon – Plumer square – Keren HaYesod – King George – Hillel – Menashe Ben Israel – Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\n\nEntrance to the parade course: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square, the intersection of Ha’histadrut/Hillel streets.\nExit from the parade route: at the Assembly area at HaPa’amon Garden, Paris Square and Gan Ha’Atzmaut (Independence Park)\nEntry and Exit from the parade route shall not be permitted at other points of the course (except in extraordinary situations).\n\n*The timetable is subject to change according to the number of participants and Police guidelines\n**Closer to the date of the event, police guidelines with regards to road closure times and recommended public transport routes to the area.\n***It is recommended to bring a bottle of water and warm clothes for the chilly
